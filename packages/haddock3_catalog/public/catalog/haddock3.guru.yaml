        $comment: HADDOCK3 checks and processes the input PDB files to ensure they
          all comply with HADDOCK3's requirements. These checks concerns, for example,
          residue numbering, compatibility of chain IDs, and many others. You can
          see all checks performs in the live issue https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/143.
          If set to false, no checks are performed and HADDOCK3 directly uses the

        description: Clean the module if run succeeds by compressing or removing output
          files.
        $comment: When running haddock through the command-line, the 'clean' parameter
          will instruct the workflow to clean the output files of the module if the
          whole run succeeds. In this process, PDB and PSF files are compressed to
          gzip, with the extension `.gz`. While files with extension `.seed`, `.inp`,
          and `.out` files are archived, and the original files deleted. The time
          to perform a cleaning operation depends on the number of files in the folders
          and the size of the files. However, it should not represent a limit step
          in the workflow. For example, a rigidbody sampling 10,000 structures takes
          about 4 minutes in our servers. This operation uses as many cores as allowed
          by the user in the 'ncores' parameter. SSD disks will perform faster by
          definition. See also the 'haddock3-clean' and 'haddock3-unpack' command-line
          clients.

          atoms can be in principle discarded. This saves computing time. However
          this should not be done if you are defining distance restraints to specific

          Setting the limit to FALSE is useful when the topoaa module is followed

          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

          the specified molecule. If >=1 then those must be defined manually with
          starting and end residue numbers in the fle_sta_ and fle_end_ variables.

        title: Center of mass restraints
        description: Automatically defines distance restraints between the geometric
          center of the various molecules.
        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

      cmtight:

        title: Center of mass restraint tightness
        description: Defines the upper distance limit based on the sum of the average
          dimension of the two molecule, if cmtight=false all three dimensions are
          used, if set to true the shortest two only are used, resulting in tighter
          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

          based on contacts. Those can also be manually defined by defining the number

          removed depends on the npart parameter which defines in how many sets the

        $comment: If set to true (default) this will cause the random removal of ambiguous
          restraints for each model generated. The fraction of restraints randomly
          removed depends on the npart parameter which defines in how many sets the
          restraints should be randomly split. The first set will be removed. The
          fraction of randomly removed ambiguous restraints is thus 1/npart.

        title: Center of mass restraints
        description: Automatically defines distance restraints between the geometric
          center of the various molecules.
        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.
