        $comment: HADDOCK3 checks and processes the input PDB files to ensure they
          all comply with HADDOCK3's requirements. These checks concerns, for example,
          residue numbering, compatibility of chain IDs, and many others. You can
          see all checks performs in the live issue https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/143.
          If set to false, no checks are performed and HADDOCK3 directly uses the
          original input PDBs.

        $comment: haddock3-analyse is a cli (see https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/main/src/haddock/clis/cli_analyse.py)
          used to plot the results of a HADDOCK3 workflow. If this option, this command

          been configured during installation. If not you can specify with the cns_exec

        $comment: If you want to spare a minimum amount of resources for daily tasks,
          set max_cpus to false; in that case the maximum number of CPUs allowed will
          be the total available in the machine minus 1. This calculation is done

          to limit the load on the queueing system and also make sure jobs remain
          in the queue for some time (if concat > 1) to avoid high system loads on

          on job script. This allows to concatenate the generation of models into
          one script. In that way jobs might run longer in the batch system and reduce

          folder to ensure that all scripts are available within the run dir. This
          can be useful for for example remote execution of a job or for debugging

        title: Clean the module output files.
        description: Clean the module if run succeeds by compressing or removing output
          files.
        $comment: When running haddock through the command-line, the 'clean' parameter
          will instruct the workflow to clean the output files of the module if the
          whole run succeeds. In this process, PDB and PSF files are compressed to
          gzip, with the extension `.gz`. While files with extension `.seed`, `.inp`,
          and `.out` files are archived, and the original files deleted. The time
          to perform a cleaning operation depends on the number of files in the folders
          and the size of the files. However, it should not represent a limit step
          in the workflow. For example, a rigidbody sampling 10,000 structures takes
          about 4 minutes in our servers. This operation uses as many cores as allowed
          by the user in the 'ncores' parameter. SSD disks will perform faster by
          definition. See also the 'haddock3-clean' and 'haddock3-unpack' command-line
          clients.

          embedded as a link to the plotly.js library and fetched from the web, or
          directly copied on the html files AT THE COST OF ~3Mb per file. Setting
          this parameter to `true` will add the javascript library in generated files,
          therefore completely isolating haddock3 from any web call.

            operations by writing intermediate input, output and error files on disk.
            Turning it to false can be useful for example when running on a network
            file system where I/O operations are slow.

          supported) and the segments to which those apply must be defined. In addition
          a custom symmetry restraint file can be supplied (symrest_fname).

        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

        $comment: This parameter defines the number of semi-flexible segments for
          the specified molecule. If set to -1 then those are automatically defined
          based on contacts. Those can also be manually defined by defining the number
          of segment (nseg>=1). In that case the starting and ending residues of each
          segment must be defined. The position of atoms in regions outside the semi-flexible
          regions will have weak harmonic positional restraints during the energy
          minimisation. If nseg is set to 0, then the molecule will be kept ridig.

          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance

        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

        $comment: CNS, the computational engine used by HADDOCK can generate a lot
          of output messages. This parameter controls the verbosity of CNS (verbose,
          normal or quiet).

        $comment: Enables symmetry restraints. The symmetry type (C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,S3
          supported) and the segments to which those apply must be defined. In addition
          a custom symmetry restraint file can be supplied (symrest_fname).
