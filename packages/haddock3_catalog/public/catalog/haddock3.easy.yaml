          all comply with HADDOCK3's requirements. These checks concerns, for example,
          residue numbering, compatibility of chain IDs, and many others. You can
          see all checks performs in the live issue https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/issues/143.
          If set to false, no checks are performed and HADDOCK3 directly uses the

          to limit the load on the queueing system and also make sure jobs remain
          in the queue for some time (if concat > 1) to avoid high system loads on

        title: Clean the module output files.
        description: Clean the module if run succeeds by compressing or removing output
          files.
        $comment: When running haddock through the command-line, the 'clean' parameter
          will instruct the workflow to clean the output files of the module if the
          whole run succeeds. In this process, PDB and PSF files are compressed to
          gzip, with the extension `.gz`. While files with extension `.seed`, `.inp`,
          and `.out` files are archived, and the original files deleted. The time
          to perform a cleaning operation depends on the number of files in the folders
          and the size of the files. However, it should not represent a limit step
          in the workflow. For example, a rigidbody sampling 10,000 structures takes
          about 4 minutes in our servers. This operation uses as many cores as allowed
          by the user in the 'ncores' parameter. SSD disks will perform faster by
          definition. See also the 'haddock3-clean' and 'haddock3-unpack' command-line
          clients.

          embedded as a link to the plotly.js library and fetched from the web, or
          directly copied on the html files AT THE COST OF ~3Mb per file. Setting
          this parameter to `true` will add the javascript library in generated files,
          therefore completely isolating haddock3 from any web call.

            operations by writing intermediate input, output and error files on disk.
            Turning it to false can be useful for example when running on a network
            file system where I/O operations are slow.
