  label: "\nRMSD clustering module.\n\nThis module takes in input the RMSD matrix\
    \ calculated in the previous step and\nperforms a hierarchical clustering procedure\
    \ on it, leveraging `scipy routines`_\nfor this purpose.\n\nEssentially, the procedure\
    \ amounts at lumping the input models in a\nprogressively coarser hierarchy of\
    \ clusters, called the dendrogram.\n\nFour parameters can be defined in this context:\n\
    \n* `linkage`: governs the way clusters are merged together in the creation of\n\
    \  the dendrogram\n* `criterion`: defines the prescription to cut the dendrogram\
    \ and obtain the\n  desired clusters\n* `tolerance`:\n    * if `criterion` is\
    \ ``maxclust``, this is the number of desired\n      clusters.\n    * if `criterion`\
    \ is ``distance``, it must be the value of\n      distance that separates distinct\
    \ clusters.\n      \n  If not specified, the default is calculated either as the\
    \ total number of\n  models divided by four (`maxclust`) or as the average of\
    \ the dendrogram height\n  (`distance`)\n* `threshold` : analogously to the `clustfcc`\
    \ module, it is the minimum number\n  of models that should be present in a cluster\
    \ to consider it\n\nThis module passes the path to the RMSD matrix is to the next\
    \ step of the\nworkflow through the `rmsd_matrix.json` file, thus allowing to\
    \ execute several\n`clustrmsd` modules (possibly with different parameters) on\
    \ the same RMSD\nmatrix.\n\n.. _scipy routines: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.hierarchy.html\n"

          bound defined by the error_dih parameter. Those restraints can be applied

          (alphabeta) or only to the alpha helical regions (alpha). Those are automatically
          detected based on the measured dihedral angle combinations.
