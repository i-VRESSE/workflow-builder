          been configured during installation. If not you can specify with the cns_exec

          to the batch system. In combination with the concat parameter this allow
          to limit the load on the queueing system and also make sure jobs remain
          in the queue for some time (if concat > 1) to avoid high system loads on
          the batch system.

          script. In that way jobs might run longer in the batch system and reduce
          the load on the scheduler.

        title: Keep or remove non-polar hydrogen atoms
        description: If set to true, non-polar hydrogen atoms will be discarded to
          save computing time
        $comment: Since HADDOCK uses a united atom force field, the non-polar hydrogen
          atoms can be in principle discarded. This saves computing time. However
          this should not be done if you are defining distance restraints to specific
          hydrogen atoms (e.g. when using NMR distance restraints).
